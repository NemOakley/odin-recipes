# odin-recipes
This is the HTML recipe website project for The Odin Project. In this particular area I am suppose to reflect on the current project. To describe what this project is currently about would be to illustrate the first steps of a baby learning to walk. There are many mistakes made along the way, but eventually we all get tired of stumbling an make some progress. 

Through this recipe project I shall endeavor to flail about, hacking and slashing until I create something akin to an online Betty Crocker brutalist website. 

Good luck to all of those who stumble across this, and heres to eventually learning how to sprint.
