    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>What you'll need to make this pizza
        <li>Firstly, you will need some pizza dough. This can be store bought or made from scratch, for beginners we recommend purchasing some from a local store.</li>
        <li>Next, you should spread out the dough into a circle; making sure not to spread too thin or leave the dough too thick</li>
        <li>Next, you will need some pizza sauce, which you should spread out around the dough using a spoon. Make sure to leave about an inch of dough uncovered around the edges, that will be your crust. </li>
        <li>After spreading the sauce, you should sprinkle some cheese onto the pizza, mozzarella should work just fine. Go heavy or light, it is all personal preference. </li>
        <li>Next, add the bacon. Personally one can never add too much, but adjust to your preferences</li>
        <li>After the pizza has been assembled, make sure the oven has been heated to an appropriate temperature, such as 350 degree fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes have passed or the crust appears golden brown and cruncy, your pizza is ready to be pulled out of the over and consumed after a 3 minute cooling process.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!!!</li>
